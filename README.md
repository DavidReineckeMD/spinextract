# SpineXtract: Fast intraoperative AI-based classifcation of common spinal tumor using stimulated Raman histology

Implementation code for SpineXtract.


[**Final Article available in XX**]



## Clinical Impact
SpineXtract addresses a critical gap in spinal tumor surgery through its ability to deliver rapid and accurate diagnostic insights that enhance intraoperative and clinical decision-making processes. By significantly reducing diagnostic timelines, this technology has the potential to shorten surgical duration and improve workflow efficiency. The system's robust performance across our international virtual trial demonstrates its adaptability to diverse clinical environments and delivers intraoperative visual feedback for immediate surgical guidance and further decision-making.

## Technical Impact
Our transformer-based classifier leverages advanced self-attention mechanisms within each image patch to optimize feature extraction and classification accuracy. The model partitions input embeddings into divisible segments, applying targeted attention to the most diagnostically relevant features within each patch. This domain-specific architectural adaptation enhances SpineXtract's ability to identify subtle histological patterns characteristic of different spinal tumor types, resulting in superior performance on this critical downstream clinical task compared to current state-of-the-art approaches.

# Training / evaluation instructions

The code base is written using PyTorch Lightning, with custom network and
datasets.


## spinextract training with adapted BYOL algorithm
1. Download and uncompress the data.
2. Update the sample config file in `train/config/train_spinextract.yaml` with
    desired configurations.
3. Change directory to `train` and activate the conda virtual environment.
4. Use `train/train_contrastive.py` to start training:
    ```console
    python train_contrastive.py -c config/train_spinextract.yaml
    ```
5. To run linear, transformer or finetuning protocol, update the config file
    `train/config/train_finetune.yaml` and continue training using
    `train/train_finetune.py`:
    ```console
    python train_finetune.py -c config/train_finetune.yaml
    ```


## Model evaluation
1. Update the sample config file in `train/config/eval.yaml` with desired
    configurations, including the PyTorch Lightning checkpoint you would like
    to use.
2. Change directory to `eval` and activate the conda virtual environment.
3. Use `eval/eval.py` to start training:
    ```console
    python eval.py -c config/eval.yaml
    ```
